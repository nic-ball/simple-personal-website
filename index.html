    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Nic, thank you for taking the time to read my brief portfolio.
        I am someone who enjoys all things technology related.
        For the past 10+ years I have been dipping my toe into the world of software development.
        Although I have a good general grasp of methodologies and workflows surrounding software development and can find answers through the wonderful power of searching I find that I still struggle with confidence on certain tasks when thinking about writing actual code.
        My hope for this course is to improve my coding skills and gain the required confidence to achieve my potential.
        My goal is to complete the course and gain the relevant qualification and then persue a carrer in the software sector here in Cardiff.
    </p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>I spend my free time gaming, mainly playing Gran Turismo 7, GTA V, Red Dead Redemption I and II as well as Fallout games and No Mans Sky.
        I also enjoy watching sci-fi shows like Doctor Who and Fallout, as well as late night talk shows from the USA.
        On Saturdays I will be found watching Burnley FC attempting to win a football game.
